SympaSOAP-Server

Alternative SOAP server for Sympa

Motivation
 - The current Sympa SOAP Server implementation is not SOAP 1.1 compliant, as it uses document/rpc encoding.
 - Authentification is very special in the current Sympa implementation (you need to login, first to get a cookie, which is anything else than WSE Security and needs special client implementations to support it. E.g. Axis2, Spring-WS or Apache CXF need heavy implimentation specific extensions to support this authentification). 
 - From a functional point of view, the current implementation is very basic and not suited to manage Sympa Lists by Soap completely. 

Goal
Due to this issues, we decided to implement our own  Sympa SOAP implementation which is 
 - Soap 1.1 document/literal compliant
 - Supports WSE compliant authentification scheme with UsernameToken WSSE headers.
 - Fits our functional needs to CRUD Mailing Lists with their Admins and Members.
 - Returns faults in case of errors.
